**[Voting Rights and the Resilience of Black Turnout](/files/Raze_2022_EconInq_VotingRights.pdf)**, 2022  
*Economic Inquiry*  

> **Abstract:** The Voting Rights Act of 1965 increased turnout among Black voters, which then generated economic benefits for Black communities. In *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), the Supreme Court invalidated the enforcement mechanism responsible for these improvements, prompting concerns that states with histories of discriminatory election practices would respond by suppressing Black turnout. I estimate the effect of the *Shelby* decision on the racial composition of the electorate using triple-difference comparisons of validated turnout data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. The data suggest that the *Shelby* decision did not widen the Black-white turnout gap in states subject to the ruling.

### Working Papers

**[Does the Salience of Race Mitigate Gaps in Disciplinary Outcomes? Evidence from School Fights](/files/RazeWaddell_Salience-of-Race.pdf)** (with Glen Waddell)

> **Abstract:** Racial gaps in the adjudication of student misconduct are well documented---for similar behaviors, students of color are more likely to be disciplined and discipline tends to be	harsher. While students of color do receive harsher punishments, on average, we show that this differential depends on the racial composition of incidents. Consistent with	administrators moving toward equal treatment when variation in race is more salient, multi-race incidents evidence no differentials in our data. In fact, when a white student is implicated in the same incident as a student of color, punishments imposed on students of color are indistinguishable from those imposed on white students in all-white incidents.
