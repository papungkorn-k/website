### Job Market Paper

**[Not Just Food but the Workers Behind: What does district spending for food service workers do for student performance?](/files/JMP_Kitcharoenkarnkul.pdf)**

> **Abstract:** The importance of school food is widely known, but the literature is silent on the impact of food service workers who make meals possible in schools. This study analyzes the link between districts’ spending on food workers and students’ academic performance, based on two nationally representative datasets. I use the district fixed effects model to examine the relationship between district spending on the compensation of food service workers and student test scores. I find a positive relationship between spending on food service workers and English test scores, and this association is greater and more significant among lower than upper grades. Students from all racial/ethnic groups benefit from increased spending on food service workers, although the results are significant for white, Black, and Hispanic students. The results of this study shed light on a new way of improving student outcomes by calling for more investment in school food and the food service workers.
